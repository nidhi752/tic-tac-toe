# tic-tac-toe

The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game (also called Noughts and Crosses) or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

In this code, I've used minimax algorithm to help the computer where to go for the next move and win the puzzle.

Combinatorics :
When considering only the state of the board, and after taking into account board symmetries (i.e. rotations and reflections), there are only 138 terminal board positions. A combinatorics study of the game shows that when "X" makes the first move every time.
